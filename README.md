## **Project Significance**

This interactive map advances global research on land management higher education by consolidating programs worldwide into a single, easily navigable reference. It equips students, researchers, and practitioners with a global perspective that moves beyond regional viewpoints and supports future comparative studies. The platform highlights the breadth of land-related academic offerings and encourages dialogue across institutions by making the underlying database broadly accessible.

---

## **Platform**

The client-side application combines HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Leaflet.js to deliver a fast, serverless mapping experience. All visualizations and interactions run directly in the browser, making the project easy to deploy and maintain.

---

## **Known Limitation / Data Precision**

**Geographical Coordinates:** Part of the university coordinates may only be accurate to the city scale. Subsequent efforts will focus on detailed precision correction.

---

## **Data Status and Contributions**

The base database (Version V1.0.1) was compiled manually by Qiushi Yi and currently documents 216 programs from 155 universities across 66 countries (as of 30 September 2025). Omission of institutions is possible, and community contributions are welcomed to improve coverage.

To contribute, edit **Add_Your_University_Program.csv** on GitHub or send updates directly via email to **qiushi.yi@tum.de**. Verified contributors will be acknowledged in future releases.

## **Geographical Disclaimer**

The project uses OpenStreetMap base layers. Boundary depictions and place names originate from the OSM API and are presented solely for reference. The visualization remains politically neutral and does not assert any position on territorial representation.

## **Data Collection Methodology**

Data collection adhered to a systematic manual review of public university sources, academic publications, and search engines. Inclusion required an active bachelor's or master's program with publicly accessible information that explicitly references land, territory, or cadastre in its title or description.

### **Selection Criteria Rationale: Focusing on "Land" as the Naming Standard**

As we acknowledge, the field of land management is highly interdisciplinary, and many educational programs dealing with land-related affairs may not explicitly include "Land" in their formal titles (e.g., specific programs in GIS, Public Administration, or Environmental Studies).

However, this research intentionally focuses on programs that use "Land," "Territory," "Cadastre," or related terms in their naming conventions. We hold that the program name itself inherently conveys its primary objective and disciplinary focus. The specific goal of this study is to aggregate and analyze academic programs that self-identify and market themselves with "Land" as a central component, thereby bringing together the core community of land-focused higher education. This approach allows us to create a precise inventory of programs dedicated primarily to land management education.
